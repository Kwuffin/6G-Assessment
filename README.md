# 6G-Assessment
Dear 6G,

This is what I came up with for your assessment.
I tried to show as many different things as I could
such as f-strings, typing, etc. Though there are a lot more things that I know are possible in Python3 such as list-comprehensions,
walrus-operators and one-line if-else statements. I hope you will be satisfied with my solution.

## How to run
First of all you'll need to clone this repository to your local/virtual machine with a `git pull` command.

Once the project is on your machine, you'll need to install dependencies (preferably in a new virtual environment). Do this with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that you're ready to go ahead and run `main.py`. Once the script has completed its work, you'll see a new file in `data/employee_data_compensation.csv`.
```
python main.py
```
